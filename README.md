# My Node.js TypeScript App

This project is a Node.js application built with TypeScript that integrates with various APIs, including Slack, Google, and Notion. It is structured to facilitate the development of workflows and agents that interact with these integrations.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-node-ts-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file:**
   Add your environment variables as needed for the integrations.

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- The application initializes in `src/index.ts`. You can modify this file to set up your integrations and workflows.
- Each integration (Slack, Google, Notion) has its own file in the `src/integrations/` directory, where you can implement specific API calls and logic.
- The `src/agents/` and `src/workflows/` directories are placeholders for your agent logic and workflow orchestration, respectively.
- Use the logger utility from `src/utils/logger.ts` for logging throughout the application.
